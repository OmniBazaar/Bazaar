# OmniBazaar User Documentation

## Overview

OmniBazaar is a decentralized marketplace that allows users to buy and sell items using cryptocurrency. The platform provides secure transactions through an escrow system and stores listing information on the blockchain using NFTs.

## Key Features

### SecureSend (Payment Protection Service)

SecureSend is a payment protection service that ensures safe transactions between buyers and sellers. Here's how it works:

1. **Creating a Protected Transaction**
   - When making a purchase, you can choose to use SecureSend
   - The system will hold your payment in escrow until the transaction is complete
   - A small fee (1%) is charged for this service
   - You can select an escrow agent to oversee the transaction

2. **Transaction Process**
   - Buyer initiates the transaction with SecureSend
   - Payment is held in escrow
   - Seller ships the item
   - Once the buyer receives and verifies the item, they can release the payment
   - If there's a dispute, the escrow agent can help resolve it

3. **Dispute Resolution**
   - Both buyer and seller can vote on the transaction outcome
   - The escrow agent can also vote to help resolve disputes
   - A 2-of-3 voting system ensures fair resolution
   - Funds are released based on the voting outcome
